## üìë Folder Conventions 

Each class folder contains:

| Folder          | Purpose                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `follow-along/` | Code written live while following the trainer |
| `exercises/`    | In-class or homework practice exercises       |
| `lab/`          | Lab assignments                               |
<br>

**P/S:** I still need to rework some file naming because it is quite inconsistent for now.
